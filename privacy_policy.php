                            request is received we will erase <br> your data within 30 days. Statutory storage obligations or
                            the need for legal actions that may arise from misconduct within <br> the services or payment
                            problems can lead to a longer retention of your personal data. In this case, we will inform

                        <p>When you visit our web pages, remarketing tags will build a direct connection between your
                            browser and the Facebook <br> server. This way, Facebook learns that you have visited our web
                            page with your IP address. This will enable Facebook to match <br> your visit of our pages with
                            your user account. The information obtained this way can be used to display Facebook ads.
                            Please <br> note that we as the provider of the webpages do not receive any information on the

                            and, e.g., arrange for contents or ads to be shown only to visitors of our Website. The data <br>
                            collected this way will be encrypted and transferred to Facebook and is anonymous for us,
                            e.g., we cannot see personal data <br> of individual users.</p>

                        <p>We may also utilise other tools, such as 
                            to build anonymous behavioural segments, and pass the status of <br> membership of these
                            segment(s) into the Facebook cookie. This will enable membership of these segments to be <br>
                            used when building Custom Audiences within Facebook.</p>

                        <p>If you do not wish your data to be collected via Custom Audience, you can deactivate Custom

                        <p>1. Social media plug-ins</p>

                        <p>We use the following social media plug-ins: Facebook, Twitter. This allows you to communicate
                            with such services and like or <br> comment from our website. Social media plug-ins enable a

                            allowing the social media provider to communicate with you and collect information about you <br>
                            browsing our website. This processing is based on Article 6 sec. 1 sent. 1 lit. f GDPR and

                        <p>Please note that we neither have the control of the extent of personal data that is collected
                            by the respective plug-in provider <br> nor do we know the processing’s purpose or the period

                        <p>a) Facebook Social Plugins</p>

                        <p>We use so-called social plugins („plugins“) of the social networking site
                            facebook.com,&nbsp;a service of Meta Platforms Inc, 1 <br> Hacker Way Menlo Park, California
                            94025, USA (“Meta”). The plugins can be identified by one of Facebook’s logos (white “f” <br> on
                            blue tile or a “thumps-up”-sign) or by the additional text “Facebook Social Plugin”. The
                            list of Facebook Social Plugins
                        </p>
                        <p>If a user visits one of the websites using such a plugin, the user’s browser directly
                            connects to Facebook’s servers. The plugin <br> and its content are made available directly on
                            Facebook’s servers and included in the website by the user’s browser.</p>

                        <p>Due to the integration of the plugin Facebook collects the information that a user is
                            visiting the corresponding website. If the <br> user is logged in on Facebook at the moment he or
                            she visits the website, Facebook may be able to connect the visit on the <br> website to the
                            user’s Facebook account. If the user interacts with the plugin – for example if he or she
                            presses the like button <br> or comments on something – the user’s browser transmits this
                            information to Facebook. Facebook stores this information. If a <br> user is not a member of
                            Facebook, Facebook may collect and store the user’s IP-address. Facebook states that it only
                            collects <br> anonymized IP-addresses in Germany.</p>

                        <p>The reason for and scope of the data acquisition and information about the way in which the
                            data is processed and used by <br> Facebook, as well as the user’s rights in this respect and
                            settings options for protecting the users privacy </p>

                        <p>If the user is a member of Facebook and does not wish Facebook to collect personal data via
                            this homepage and to link this <br> with his data stored on Facebook, the user needs to log off
                            from Facebook before going to this homepage <br></p>

                        <p>The user may also block Facebook’s plugins using add-ons for the user’s browser, for example
                            
                            the “Facebook Blocker“.</p>
                            
                        <p>Twitter</p>

                        <p>We use the twitter-button. The button is provided by Twitter Inc., 795 Folsom St., Suite 600,
                            San Francisco, CA 94107, USA. <br> (“Twitter”) The buttons are marked using the text “Twitter” or
                            “Follow” and a stylized blue bird. The button enables the user to <br> share an article or a
                            website of this homepage on Twitter or to follow the provider on Twitter.</p>
                        <p>If a user visits one of the websites using such a button, the user’s browser directly
                            connects to Twitter’s servers. The Twitter- <br>button and its content are loaded directly from
                            Twitter’s servers and included in the website by the user’s browser. According <br> to the
                            provider’s knowledge, Twitter collects the user IP-address and the website’s URL when the
                            button is loaded from <br> Twitter’s servers. However, this data is only be used for loading and
                            displaying the Twitter-button.</p>
