       <div class="">
			<h2 class="heading1">Benefits of publishing with us</h2>
			<p class="">We pride ourselves on providing a supportive and accessible service for our authors throughout<br> the publishing process. Over one million authors have chosen to publish with us over the past 15 <br>years because of the service and results we deliver:</p>

       <div class="">
            <h2 class="heading1" >Open research</h2>
			<p class="" >Since 1999, all our research has been open access which means it’s free to access from anywhere<br> in the world, and licensed for reuse. As well as being published on our website, your research will<br> be available on SpringerLink, Google Scholar, PubMed Central, Medline, Scopus and all other<br> major full-text repositories, with journals indexed in these repositories as early as possible. We<br> also encourage deposition of raw data in open data repositories. Read our open data policy.</p>
            <p class="" >As an author you retain the copyright to your work. By licensing your work under the Creative<br> Commons Attribution License, articles can be re-used and re-distributed without restriction, as<br> long as the original work is correctly cited.</p>
       </div>
       <div class="">
            <h2 class="heading1">Speed</h2>
			<p class="">We offer fast publication while providing rigorous peer review to maintain the integrity of<br>information. Our times from submission to first decision vary depending on the journal, but in<br>the majority of BMC journals, once your content is accepted it will be published online shortly<br>afterwards. In some cases content may be held for specific reasons for a short period of time. As<br>your article will be open access, it will be immediately and freely available and reusable without<br>restriction.</p>
		</div>
        <div class="">
            <h2 class="heading1">Quality</h2>
            <p class="">We are committed to the highest standards of peer review. The Editorial Board of each journal<br>determines their peer review policy, while maintaining our high standards. Editorial and peer<br>review policies are available in the “Submission Guidelines” on each journal’s website. All our<br>editors are supported by our in-house Research Integrity Group who advise on policy, decision-<br>making, plagiarism and ethics to ensure every decision is as fair and transparent as possible.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="">    
            <h2 class="heading1">Impact</h2>
            <p class="">We’re proud of the impact and influence our journals have - from citations to social media <br>shares; from advancing discovery within individual disciplines to affecting public discourse and<br> policy making.</p>
        </div>
       <div class="">
            <h2 class="heading1">Visibility</h2>
            <p class="">We’re committed to promoting your research as widely as we can and providing as much<br> visibility and exposure for your article as possible. We have a dedicated press team who work<br> with global media to highlight research of interest to the public and science media, regularly<br> leading to extensive   coverage in the press. We also ensure your research is easy to find and<br> cite, making your ideas and knowledge accessible to other researchers, communities and<br> institutions around the world.</p>
