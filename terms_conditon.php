                        <p>Guided Open Access (“Guided OA”) is a programme that enables you to submit your Article to
                            one xana Research journal, and be considered simultaneously by two other associated
                            journals in the xana Portfolio. See our <a

                                page</a> for further details on the Guided OA programme.</p>
                        <h4>a.Initial Submission</h4>
                        <p>In order to participate in the Guided OA programme, you must select the Guided OA option when
                            submitting your Article to a participating xana Research Journal, and provide all
                            information required pursuant to the submission process. If your Article is deemed
                            appropriate for the Guided OA programme, it will be assigned to a handling editor from one
                            of the participating journals, and you will be asked to arrange payment of an Editorial
                            Assessment Charge (see Charges, below). If your Article is determined not to be suitable for
                            any of the journals in the Guided OA programme, you will be notified and no Editorial
                            Assessment Charge will be payable.</p>
                        <h4>b.Editorial Assessment Report</h4>
                        <p>Once your article has been assigned to a handling&nbsp; editor and you have provided billing
                            details for the Editorial Assessment Charge, your Article will be sent for peer review in
                            accordance with our standard practices. On the basis of their expert judgement, and the
                            feedback from one round of peer review, the xana Portfolio editor responsible for your
                            Article will prepare an Editorial Assessment Report (EAR). The EAR will typically provide an
                            editorial evaluation of the manuscript, an open research evaluation, guidance for adhering
                            to best reproducibility practice, and help to navigate and interpret the reviewers’
                            feedback, but contents of individual EARs may vary. If your Article is provisionally
                            recommended for publication after the first round of peer review, the EAR will recommend
                            which journal(s) will be suitable for publication of your Article. If you choose to continue
                            with a recommended journal, the peer review process will continue in accordance with the
                            journal’s standard practice. However, you are under no obligation to continue with a
                            recommended journal, and may use the EAR in connection with preparation for submission of
                            your Article to another journal. <strong>YOU UNDERSTAND AND AGREE THAT YOUR PARTICIPATION IN
